# Symbolic mathematics toolkit

> Explainable symbolic-numeric workflows for equations, optimization, dynamical systems, and research mathematics.

## Why this project exists

This repository is an open-source research and engineering blueprint for a difficult problem at the intersection of machine learning, scientific computing, and real-world energy or infrastructure systems. It is designed to grow from a transparent baseline into a reproducible benchmark and deployable reference implementation.

## Intended industry use cases

Problem families relevant to **OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft** include efficient infrastructure, energy transition, intelligent assets, scientific discovery, and reliable decision support. This repository is independent and does not claim affiliation, endorsement, or use of proprietary company data.

## Planned capabilities

- Reproducible data ingestion and validation contracts
- Strong statistical and deep-learning baselines
- Temporal or physics-aware feature engineering
- Calibration, uncertainty quantification, and stress testing
- Experiment tracking, ablation studies, and model cards
- FastAPI inference service and Docker deployment blueprint
- Unit tests, documentation, and GitHub Actions quality checks

## Research roadmap

1. Define the mathematical problem and data contract.
2. Implement a leakage-safe baseline with deterministic evaluation.
3. Add the deep-learning or scientific-ML model family.
4. Compare accuracy, robustness, compute cost, and interpretability.
5. Add uncertainty estimates, monitoring, and reproducible release artifacts.

## Status

**Research blueprint — actively being expanded.** Results should be treated as experimental until datasets, baselines, and evaluation reports are published.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pytest -q
```

The current release is intentionally a transparent baseline. Replace demo data with a documented, licensed dataset before drawing scientific or business conclusions.
